High Order Components
Render Props

Context API

- main container in app.js
- app.js in index.js is HtMl div
- mostly components 

Props drilling - data is passed to each child componet before to the actual component who needs it. (Hierarchical Structure)

Context API: provide and consume data directly from the required component not from parent.

For this purpose

-	Create context
-	Provide
-	Consume
-	Normaly context is in father of all components so each can use it

Redux vs Use_Reducer
vs Context API

Context API to avoid prop drilling

Context API doest not allow data sharing between siblings and child to parent.

Redux gives global state management, no one is owner

to communicate data between sibling

Props are read only, it should not be changed by any components. if component change it, that becomes impure component
