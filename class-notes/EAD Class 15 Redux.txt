- state management
- context-api
- reducer: callback function + initial state

- context-api + reducer: gives global statement touch using hooks. introducesd in around 2015
- redux is old, most used and most popular but now a days context-api+reducer is easy

ui(iphone)-> action (add product) -> ui sends action to reducer(reducer will manipulate state and that state will be in store, there can be multiple stores and all can be provided to app),

action folder: directly target the index files for actions

actions defined in index.js

Enhance object literal, computer property, object destructuring

firt made ui
then action folder containing inedex which have like increment or dec, export them
then reducer folder containing index file contaiting state and reducer with initial state and action manipulating that state
create another folder named store
us store ko humne reducer de diya

store ko export karne k liye common parent (App.js jaha use ho raha ha) ko provide karein ge throug provider
now conusme karein ge

now import connect from react-redux

its a function
const mapStateToProps = (state)=>{return {count: state.count}}

aik complex state ha {product, count, name} but jab counter ko yeh object do sirf count. 
hence it will pass only useful state to the counter, that is why mapStateToProps

connect is a function which is passing specfice state as a props to the Counter

props k through dispact function mile ga jis mein payload pass karein ge with given thypes

react is actual react, react-dom is part of react
redux is also a separtate package which can be used.
in vue.js, angular redux can also be used
to use redux in react, another library react-redux can be used

redux, react-redux
