Stateful logic: maintaining state with using some logic

if same stateful logic in reused in multiple component/files, wo dont do that. we can use contextApI/ Higher order function/ 

Aik component will be taking 2nd component(wrapped component) as argument with modification in stateful logic and will return transformed component.

if a method is using this keyword. then that method is need to be bind otherwise you can you use arrow function to avoid bind
